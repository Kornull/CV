  "about": "Hi, I am a Front-end developer. I have completed a course at the Rolling Scopes School. It wasn't an easy way, but I did it and I can say that it was cool. I did a lot of projects and gained a lot of knowledge. I met some interesting people and web development professionals. I tried my hand as a team leader in team development. Now it's time to move on and I'm looking for a company that will allow me to work with an interesting product and reach my full potential."
